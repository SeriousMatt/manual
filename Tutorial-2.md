# Lesson 2 - Coin Jar

For this lesson I created the test API that I started in the last lesson and I'm 
going to do something with it.  You might have wondered why it was a JarAPI and what that meant.   This little project is going to be a coin jar, where you can query the number of coins in the jar, and add to the jar.  

This might be a reward Jar for my kids, where if they do their chores they get a virtual coin.
And when we reach a threshold, we could go get a treat.

Or this could be a swear jar.  So when someone on the team lets loose with a stream of unsavory language.  That person will have to put coins in the jar.  
And maybe when the jar reaches a certain threshold, that person has to give the team a *&^%ing party.
