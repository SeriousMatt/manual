# Introduction

This is the "official" manual for SakuraAPI and it's ecosystem of utilities and plugins.

## Goals

SakuraAPI was started in late 2016 by J.P. Poveda, who desired to create a new framework that natively took advantage of many of the emerging standards surrounding JavaScript.

Some of the features of SakuraAPI include:

|||
|----|----|
|Good DX (developer experience)|Or so we'd like to think...|
|Native Dependency Injection|We believe a dependency injection system is important to building testable large scale applications.|
|Cascading Configuration System|SakuraApi should allow easy configuration for multiple target environments such that a portion of the configuration can be shared by all environments and specific settings can be overriden for a particular environment. We believe this is essential for supporting a robust CI/CD system|
|Plugin System|It should be easy to add plugins that enhance SakuraAPI, like support for oAuth or email authentication.|
|Decorators based API|Because we think this makes for a better DX|

Some fluffier objectives include:

|||
|----|----|
|Light Express Wrapper|SakuraApi should be as helpful as it can be, but it should quickly get out of the way when you need to do something it can't. If you know Express, SakuraApi will not interfere if you want to implement something outside of SakuraApi or if you want to utilize existing middleware.|
|Familiarity for Angular Developers|We use silmilar concepts like decorators and providers and constructor based dependency injection.|
|No legacy|We are committed to exploiting the potential of the rapidly evolving standards of the JavaScript / TypeScript community.|
|Commitment to MongoDB|Database Abstraction technologies are useful in most trivial cases but often become a burden to non-trivial implementations. We are primarily focused on supporting MongoDB at the moment. We believe that your deep knowledge of MongoDB should be directly exploitable when using SakuraApi. If SakuraApi doesn't allow for some MongoDB feature natively, it allows you to work directly with MongoDB without penalty.|
|Micro-services Oriented|SakuraApi's eco-system leans towards supporting micro-services architectures|

## Starting a new project
### Install Sakura CLI globally
`npm install --global @sakuraapi/cli`

Test to see if you have successfully installed the sakur API CLI by running 

`sapi help`
### Create a working directory
Start by creating a working directory for your project.

`mkdir example-api`
### run sapi init
`cd example init`

`sapi init`

You will go through a series of prompts to configure the project.  

1. package.json preferences:
    1. Author: 
_Your name, handle, alias, pseudonym, etc._
    1. Description: _Project description_
    1. License: _Pick a license.  If you need help visit <https://choosealicense.com/>_
    1. Project Name (npm name): _Project name_
    1. Version: _If you need help visit <http://semver.org>_
2. src/config/environment.ts preferences:
    1. What JWT role does this server fulfill?: 
    
    This has to do with the authentication needs of your project.  Your choices are 
    * __a__ for audience
    * __i__ for issuer
    * __n__ for none
    * __H__ for Help
    
    For the sake of this example, we will choose _none_.  For a description of what
    the issuer and the audience does, see corresponding projects 
    [auth-native-authority](https://github.com/sakuraapi/auth-native-authority) and   
    [auth-audience](https://github.com/sakuraapi/auth-audience_)
    
## Walk through the output of the CLI
### files created by the CLI
#### package.json
Every app needs a package.json.  The CLI pre-populates this with the dependencies Sakura API is expecting.   
#### tslint.json, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.spec.json
These three files are _typescript_ configuration files.  
They will set the standard lint and compiler configurations for your project.  
The CLI produces a recommended set of settings, but you are welcome to make changes.  
For more about these files, read 
(https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)
(https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/tslint-json/)
#### /docker/local-test.yml
This file is the YML configuration file used by docker compose to build a test container for your project.  
As a minimum, this build puts a blank mongoDB instance for your API to use.  We use a blank one in our test environment
 when developing so that old data does not create artifacts that will corrupt the test.  
 
This file is used by the script found in `scripts/docker:local-compose-up.sh`
#### /scripts
#### /src
#### /spec
